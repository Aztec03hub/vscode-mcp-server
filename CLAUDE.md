# Claude Implementation Plan: apply_diff Tool

## Project Overview
Implementation of an enhanced `apply_diff` tool for the vscode-mcp-server project, inspired by Block's `create_diff` functionality but with enhanced support for multiple diff sections in a single file.

## Reference Analysis
Based on analysis of Block's vscode-mcp repository at `remote_reference/vscode-mcp`, we identified the following key components:
- Server-side MCP tool that creates temporary files and manages diff workflow
- VS Code extension integration via socket communication
- User approval workflow with status bar buttons
- Atomic file operations with proper cleanup

## Enhanced Features Plan

### Core Enhancement: Multiple Diff Support
Unlike Block's implementation which handles single file changes, our `apply_diff` tool will support:
- **Multiple diff sections** in a single file operation
- **Unified diff view** showing all proposed changes at once
- **Single accept/reject decision** for all changes
- **Intelligent conflict detection** between diff sections
- **Clear visual separation** between different change sections

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core `apply_diff` Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### Data Structures
```typescript
interface DiffSection {
  startLine: number;     // 0-based line number
  endLine: number;       // 0-based line number (inclusive)
  originalContent: string;
  newContent: string;
  description?: string;  // Optional description for this section
}

interface ApplyDiffArgs {
  filePath: string;
  diffs: DiffSection[];  // Array of diff sections
  description?: string;  // Overall description
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Validation Phase**:
   - Ensure file exists (only works on existing files)
   - Validate all diff sections don't overlap
   - Sort diff sections by line number
   - **Fuzzy content matching** with intelligent error handling

2. **Fuzzy Matching & Issue Handling** ‚≠ê:
   - **Whitespace normalization** for content comparison
   - **Smart search algorithms** for approximate content matching
   - **Line number adjustment** when exact matches aren't found
   - **Contextual search** using surrounding lines
   - **Multiple matching strategies** with fallback options

3. **Diff Generation**:
   - Apply all diffs to create a complete modified version
   - Generate unified diff showing all changes
   - Create temporary file with all changes applied

4. **User Approval**:
   - Show unified diff in VS Code's diff viewer
   - Use status bar buttons or quick pick for accept/reject
   - Apply all changes atomically if accepted

5. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Check for overlapping line ranges
   - Detect if changes would interfere with each other
   - Provide clear error messages for conflicts

#### Files to Modify
- `src/tools/edit-tools.ts` - Add the new `apply_diff` tool
- `src/server.ts` - Register the new tool

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience & Diff View Fixes üéØ **CURRENT PHASE**

#### Critical Bug Fixes

##### 1. Diff View Persistence Issue
- **Problem**: Diff view remains open after applying changes
- **Root Cause**: Temporary file operations leave VS Code tabs open
- **Solution**: Properly close diff view after approval/rejection

##### 2. File Creation vs. Modification Flow
- **New File Scenario**:
  - Target file doesn't exist (e.g., `test.ts`)
  - Show diff between empty file and full new content
  - Create file only after user approval
- **Existing File Scenario**:
  - Show current file content vs. proposed changes
  - Apply changes to existing file after approval
- **Tab Naming**: Use descriptive pattern like `test.ts: Original ‚Üî LLM Changes (Editable) (test.ts ‚Üî C:\path_to_file) ‚Ä¢ X problems in this file ‚Ä¢ Untracked`

#### Enhanced User Approval Interface Options

##### Option 1: Status Bar Buttons ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Create status bar items with better UX
const approveButton = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Left, 1000);
approveButton.text = '$(check) Apply Changes';
approveButton.tooltip = 'Apply all proposed changes to the file';
approveButton.command = 'mcp.apply-diff.approve';
approveButton.backgroundColor = new vscode.ThemeColor('statusBarItem.prominentBackground');
approveButton.show();

const rejectButton = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Left, 999);
rejectButton.text = '$(x) Reject Changes';
rejectButton.tooltip = 'Reject changes and keep original file';
rejectButton.command = 'mcp.apply-diff.reject';
rejectButton.show();

// Add file info button
const infoButton = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Left, 998);
infoButton.text = `$(info) ${path.basename(filePath)} (${diffs.length} changes)`;
infoButton.tooltip = `Reviewing ${diffs.length} changes in ${filePath}`;
infoButton.show();
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Always visible, doesn't obstruct diff view
- ‚úÖ One-click approval/rejection
- ‚úÖ Clean, minimal interface that doesn't get in the way
- ‚úÖ Follows VS Code design patterns
- ‚úÖ Keyboard accessible (can assign shortcuts)
- ‚úÖ Shows context info (file name, change count)

##### Option 2: Elegant Floating Mini-Toolbar
**Implementation**: Small, sleek toolbar that floats near the diff view
```typescript
// Create a minimal webview overlay
const floatingToolbar = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(
    'diff-approval-toolbar',
    'Diff Actions',
    { viewColumn: vscode.ViewColumn.Active, preserveFocus: true },
    {
        enableScripts: true,
        retainContextWhenHidden: true,
        localResourceRoots: []
    }
);

// Inject elegant CSS and minimal HTML
floatingToolbar.webview.html = `
<style>
  body { 
    margin: 0; padding: 8px; 
    background: var(--vscode-editor-background);
    border: 1px solid var(--vscode-panel-border);
    border-radius: 6px;
    display: flex; gap: 8px; align-items: center;
    font-family: var(--vscode-font-family);
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
  }
  .btn { 
    padding: 6px 12px; border: none; border-radius: 4px; 
    font-size: 13px; cursor: pointer; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 4px;
  }
  .approve { background: var(--vscode-button-background); color: var(--vscode-button-foreground); }
  .reject { background: var(--vscode-button-secondaryBackground); color: var(--vscode-button-secondaryForeground); }
  .info { color: var(--vscode-foreground); font-size: 12px; }
</style>
<div class="info">${path.basename(filePath)} ‚Ä¢ ${diffs.length} changes</div>
<button class="btn approve" onclick="approve()">‚úì Apply</button>
<button class="btn reject" onclick="reject()">‚úó Reject</button>
`;
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Sleek, modern appearance
- ‚úÖ Contextual positioning
- ‚úÖ Customizable styling to match VS Code themes
- ‚úÖ Shows additional context info
- ‚úÖ Floating design doesn't interfere with editor

##### Option 3: Smart Command Palette Integration
**Implementation**: Temporary commands with intelligent shortcuts
```typescript
// Register context-sensitive commands
const approveCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand('mcp.apply-diff.approve-current', async () => {
    await applyCurrentDiff();
});

const rejectCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand('mcp.apply-diff.reject-current', async () => {
    await rejectCurrentDiff();
});

// Show elegant notification with shortcuts
vscode.window.showInformationMessage(
    `üìù Diff ready: ${diffs.length} changes in ${path.basename(filePath)}`,
    { modal: false },
    '‚úì Apply (Ctrl+Shift+A)',
    '‚úó Reject (Ctrl+Shift+R)'
);

// Register keybindings dynamically
vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', 'mcp.diffPending', true);
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing VS Code UX patterns
- ‚úÖ Keyboard-first workflow
- ‚úÖ Discoverable via command palette
- ‚úÖ Custom keybindings
- ‚úÖ Context-aware activation

##### Option 4: Minimalist Notification Toast
**Implementation**: Subtle, non-intrusive notification
```typescript
// Custom notification with timeout and actions
const notification = vscode.window.withProgress({
    location: vscode.ProgressLocation.Notification,
    title: `Apply ${diffs.length} changes to ${path.basename(filePath)}?`,
    cancellable: true
}, async (progress, token) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const actions = [
            { title: '‚úì Apply', action: 'apply' },
            { title: '‚úó Reject', action: 'reject' }
        ];
        
        // Show with timeout
        setTimeout(() => {
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage(
                `Review changes and decide...`,
                ...actions.map(a => a.title)
            ).then(resolve);
        }, 1000);
    });
});
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Subtle, non-intrusive
- ‚úÖ Auto-dismisses after timeout
- ‚úÖ Native VS Code notification system
- ‚úÖ Progress indication
- ‚úÖ Themeable

##### Option 5: Context-Aware Editor Decorations
**Implementation**: Inline decorations within the diff view
```typescript
// Add decorations to the diff editor
const decorationType = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({
    after: {
        contentText: '    [‚úì Apply All] [‚úó Reject All]',
        color: new vscode.ThemeColor('textLink.foreground'),
        backgroundColor: new vscode.ThemeColor('editor.background'),
        border: '1px solid var(--vscode-panel-border)',
        borderRadius: '3px',
        margin: '0 0 0 10px'
    },
    rangeBehavior: vscode.DecorationRangeBehavior.ClosedClosed
});

// Apply to first line of diff
const range = new vscode.Range(0, 0, 0, 0);
editor.setDecorations(decorationType, [range]);
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Contextual to actual changes
