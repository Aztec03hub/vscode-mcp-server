# Claude Implementation Plan: apply_diff Tool

## Project Overview
Implementation of an enhanced `apply_diff` tool for the vscode-mcp-server project, inspired by Block's `create_diff` functionality but with enhanced support for multiple diff sections in a single file.

## Reference Analysis
Based on analysis of Block's vscode-mcp repository at `remote_reference/vscode-mcp`, we identified the following key components:
- Server-side MCP tool that creates temporary files and manages diff workflow
- VS Code extension integration via socket communication
- User approval workflow with status bar buttons
- Atomic file operations with proper cleanup

## Enhanced Features Plan

### Core Enhancement: Multiple Diff Support
Unlike Block's implementation which handles single file changes, our `apply_diff` tool will support:
- **Multiple diff sections** in a single file operation
- **Unified diff view** showing all proposed changes at once
- **Single accept/reject decision** for all changes
- **Intelligent conflict detection** between diff sections
- **Clear visual separation** between different change sections

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core `apply_diff` Implementation ‚≠ê (Current Phase)

#### Data Structures
```typescript
interface DiffSection {
  startLine: number;     // 0-based line number
  endLine: number;       // 0-based line number (inclusive)
  originalContent: string;
  newContent: string;
  description?: string;  // Optional description for this section
}

interface ApplyDiffArgs {
  filePath: string;
  diffs: DiffSection[];  // Array of diff sections
  description?: string;  // Overall description
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Validation Phase**:
   - Ensure file exists (only works on existing files)
   - Validate all diff sections don't overlap
   - Sort diff sections by line number
   - **Fuzzy content matching** with intelligent error handling

2. **Fuzzy Matching & Issue Handling** ‚≠ê:
   - **Whitespace normalization** for content comparison
   - **Smart search algorithms** for approximate content matching
   - **Line number adjustment** when exact matches aren't found
   - **Contextual search** using surrounding lines
   - **Multiple matching strategies** with fallback options

3. **Diff Generation**:
   - Apply all diffs to create a complete modified version
   - Generate unified diff showing all changes
   - Create temporary file with all changes applied

4. **User Approval**:
   - Show unified diff in VS Code's diff viewer
   - Use status bar buttons or quick pick for accept/reject
   - Apply all changes atomically if accepted

5. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Check for overlapping line ranges
   - Detect if changes would interfere with each other
   - Provide clear error messages for conflicts

#### Files to Modify
- `src/tools/edit-tools.ts` - Add the new `apply_diff` tool
- `src/server.ts` - Register the new tool

### Phase 2: VS Code Integration Enhancement

1. **Enhanced Diff Visualization**:
   - Add section markers in the diff view
   - Include descriptions as comments in the temporary file
   - Use clear visual separators between different changes

2. **Smart Merging**:
   - Handle adjacent diff sections intelligently
   - Optimize line number calculations after each change
   - Provide preview of final result

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

1. **Partial Application**:
   - Option to apply individual diff sections
   - Interactive selection of which changes to apply

2. **Diff Statistics**:
   - Show summary of changes (lines added/removed per section)
   - Provide overview of total impact
