# Apply Diff Tool Improvement Task Plan

## Overview
Transform the `apply_diff` tool into a highly reliable, production-ready code editing tool for LLM usage with hierarchical fallback strategies, improved parameter structure, and automatic file creation capabilities.

## Core Requirements Met
- **Parameter restructuring**: `filePath` → `description` → `startLine` → `endLine` → `search` → `replace`
- **Multiple diff support**: Maintain array-based multiple diff operations
- **File creation**: Auto-create files if they don't exist
- **Hierarchical validation**: Strict-first with progressive fallbacks
- **Enhanced diagnostics**: Show expected vs. actual content clearly
- **Post-validation**: Ensure structural integrity after changes
- **Production reliability**: Minimize real-world usage errors

- [✅] Change `newContent` → `replace`
- [✅] Reorder parameters: `filePath`, `description`, `startLine`, `endLine`, `search`, `replace`
- [✅] Update TypeScript interfaces (`DiffSection`, `ApplyDiffArgs`)
- [✅] Update Zod validation schema in tool registration

#### 1.2 Backward Compatibility
- [✅] Add parameter mapping to handle both old and new parameter names temporarily

- [✅] Ensure proper directory structure creation (create parent directories if needed)
- [✅] Log file creation activities for debugging

#### 2.2 Empty File Handling
- [✅] Handle edge case where search content is provided for empty file
- [✅] Default behavior: if file is empty and search content provided, treat as "insert at beginning"

---

### Task 3: Hierarchical Validation Strategy
**Confidence: 8/10**

#### 3.1 Strict Validation (Level 1)
- [✅] **Exact match**: Character-for-character matching including whitespace

#### 3.2 Permissive Validation (Level 2)
- [✅] **Whitespace-normalized matching**: Ignore leading/trailing whitespace
- [✅] **Indentation-normalized matching**: Normalize tabs vs spaces
- [✅] **Case-insensitive matching**: Try case-insensitive if case-sensitive fails

#### 3.3 Fuzzy Validation (Level 3)
- [✅] **Similarity matching**: Use existing Levenshtein distance (threshold: 0.9→0.8→0.7)
- [✅] **Contextual matching**: Look at surrounding code context
- [✅] **Partial matching**: Allow matching subsets of the search content

#### 3.4 Fallback Chain Implementation
- [✅] Create `ValidationHierarchy` class to manage fallback progression
- [✅] Log each attempt level with detailed diagnostics
- [✅] Stop at first successful match
- [✅] Aggregate all failure reasons for final error reporting

**Confidence: 9/10**

#### 4.1 Expected vs. Actual Content Display
```typescript
interface DiagnosticInfo {
    expected: string;        // What we were searching for
    actualContent: string[];  // What we found at various locations
    searchLocations: number[]; // Line numbers where we looked
    confidence: number;       // Best match confidence
    strategy: string;         // Which strategy found the best match
}
```

#### 4.2 Structured Error Messages
- [✅] **Header**: Clear problem statement
- [✅] **Expected Content**: Show exactly what was being searched for (first)
- [✅] **Actual Content**: Show what was found instead (last)

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Principles
1. **Fail fast, fail clearly**: Quick identification of unsolvable problems
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple, add sophistication gradually  
3. **Defensive programming**: Assume inputs may be imperfect
4. **Comprehensive logging**: Every decision point should be logged
5. **User-centric errors**: Error messages should guide toward solutions

### Development Approach
1. **Test-driven development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Incremental delivery**: Each task should be independently deployable
3. **Performance monitoring**: Track metrics throughout development
4. **User feedback integration**: Collect and respond to real-world usage patterns

This plan transforms `apply_diff` into a production-ready, highly reliable tool that will serve as your primary code editing interface with minimal errors and maximum confidence.
