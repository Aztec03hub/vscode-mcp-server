# MEMORY - VS Code MCP Server Project (Shell Tools Focus)

## Purpose
This file tracks important learnings, patterns, and decisions made during the development of the vscode-mcp-server project, currently focusing on shell tools implementation.

## CRITICAL: Extension Testing Workflow
**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**: After making ANY code changes, and before running ANY tests, you MUST rebuild and reload the extension.

### ✨ NEW: Single Rebuild-and-Reload Script (✅ TESTED & WORKING)

**Complete rebuild workflow with step-by-step feedback:**
```bash
npm run rebuild-and-reload
```

**Output format:**
```
🔨 Building package...
<runs npx vsce package which calls npm run vscode:prepublish -> npm run compile>
✅ Package built successfully!
📦 Installing VSCode Extension...
<runs code --install-extension vscode-mcp-server-0.0.4.vsix --force>
✅ Extension installed successfully!
🔄 Reloading VSCode Extensions...
<runs code -r . to reload>
✅ VSCode Extensions reloaded successfully!
```

**Why this is critical**: VS Code extensions run in a separate extension host process. Changes to the code are NOT reflected until the extension is recompiled, repackaged, and reinstalled. Running tests without this process will test the OLD code, not your changes!

## General Development Patterns

### VS Code Integration Best Practices
- Use `vscode.window.withProgress` for long-running operations
- Status bar buttons for user interactions with unique command IDs
- Proper cleanup of UI elements and temporary files in finally blocks
- Always check workspace folders exist before file operations
- Use `vscode.Uri.joinPath()` for path construction
- Handle file non-existence gracefully

### File Operations
```typescript
// Always use VS Code workspace filesystem API
const content = await vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(uri);
await vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile(uri, Buffer.from(content));
```

### Error Handling Approach
- Implement custom error classes with progressive error disclosure
- Three error levels: SIMPLE, DETAILED, FULL
- Include diagnostic information for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages and debugging info

### Testing Patterns
- Always read source files in full before making changes
- Check for diagnostics after modifications using `get_diagnostics_code`
- Run linters after fixing errors
- Clear caches between test runs for proper isolation
- Use unique filenames per test to avoid cross-test contamination

### Command Execution Patterns (Applicable to Shell Tools)
- Handle async operations with proper timeout strategies
- Implement retry logic for failed operations
- Use appropriate timeouts for different operation types:
  - Default mode: 15-second timeout
  - Interactive mode: 45-second timeout
  - Background mode: Return immediately
- Detect and handle special shell states (PowerShell, Command Prompt)

### Shell-Specific Patterns
- **PowerShell Workarounds**: Add uniqueness counters and delays for VSCode Bug #237208
- **Shell Integration**: Wait for shell integration with enhanced timeout handling
- **Directory Tracking**: Use shell integration CWD when available, fallback gracefully
- **Status Management**: Track shell states (idle, busy, waiting-for-input, crashed)

### Registry Pattern (Applicable to Shell Management)
- Singleton pattern for managing resources
- Auto-cleanup for unused resources with configurable timeouts
- Event handlers for lifecycle management
- Resource limits with proper error handling
- Thread-safe resource access patterns

## Configuration Constants
```typescript
// Shell management
const MAX_SHELLS = 8;
const SHELL_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
const DEFAULT_OUTPUT_LINE_LIMIT = 1000;
const INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT_MS = 45000; // 45 seconds
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS = 15000; // 15 seconds

// Shell integration
const SHELL_INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;
const STREAM_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000;
const COMMAND_DELAY_MS = 50; // PowerShell workaround
```

## Task Management Best Practices
1. Always read any source file in full the first time using `read_file_code`
2. After making modifications, check for errors using `get_diagnostics_code`
3. Run linters/formatters after fixing source file issues
4. Maintain this MEMORY.md file for important learnings
5. Update task lists with checkmarks (✅) as items are completed
6. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks

## Architecture Decisions for Shell Tools
1. **Shell Registry System**: Centralized management of multiple shells
2. **Auto-cleanup**: Prevents resource leaks with timed cleanup
3. **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive shell state management
4. **Cross-platform Support**: Handle different shell types and behaviors
5. **Safety Features**: Basic destructive command detection (pattern matching)
6. **User Experience**: Clear status reporting and intuitive management

### Key Learnings for Shell Implementation
- Shell integration timing is critical - always wait for integration to be available
- PowerShell requires special handling due to VS Code bugs
- Directory changes need time to propagate through shell integration
- Output limiting prevents memory issues with long-running commands
- Interactive command detection requires pattern matching for common prompts
- Background processes need immediate return with status tracking

## ✅ Recent Task: Apply Diff Tool Enhancement (endLine: -1)

### Successfully Implemented Full File Replacement Feature
**Completed**: Enhanced `apply_diff` tool to support `endLine: -1` for full file replacement

**Key Achievements**:
1. ✅ **Schema Update**: Modified tool description and parameter documentation
2. ✅ **Core Logic**: Added special handling in `normalizeDiffSections` and `validateDiffSections`
3. ✅ **Validation**: Proper content validation with clear error messages
4. ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 6 test scenarios
5. ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing functionality

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `endLine: -1` detection in normalization phase
- Special validation logic for full file replacement
- Support for both new and existing files
- Clear logging for debugging and verification

**Test Results**: Functionality working correctly - logs show successful detection and processing of endLine: -1 with expected behavior for full file replacement scenarios.

## Future Considerations
- Performance optimization for output handling in long-running processes
- Advanced shell features (environment variables, history, completion)
- Cross-platform shell support improvements
- Integration with VS Code terminal themes and customization

## Apply Diff Tool Enhancement

### Full File Replacement Feature (endLine: -1)

**STATUS: MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED ✅**

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Basic `endLine: -1` functionality for full file replacement
- ✅ Parameter validation with proper error messages
- ✅ Conflict detection between multiple `endLine: -1` diffs
- ✅ Support for empty search strings in full file replacement
- ✅ Support for new file creation with `endLine: -1`

**Test Results: ALL TESTS PASSING ✅**
- ✅ All 91 tests now passing
- ✅ Line ending compatibility issue resolved
- ✅ Cross-platform test compatibility achieved

**Final Issue Resolution:**
- **Line Ending Fix**: Added line ending normalization in test assertion to handle Windows (`\r\n`) vs Unix (`\n`) line endings
- **Solution**: Used `content.replace(/\r\n/g, '\n')` to normalize content before assertion
- **Impact**: Ensures tests pass consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Key Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed parameter validation to handle empty strings vs undefined correctly
- Fixed normalization logic to preserve empty search/replace strings
- Fixed validation logic for `endLine: -1` cases to allow empty search
- Fixed conflict detection between overlapping `endLine: -1` diffs
- ✅ **FINAL FIX**: Resolved line ending compatibility in test assertions
